5. Viewing Your Updated Menu


**Troubleshooting Tips**

_I Can’t Find the Edit Button:_
Make sure you're logged in to Squarespace and that you are viewing the correct page. Check the top left for the Edit button.

_Changes Not Showing:_
Ensure you've clicked Save after editing. Sometimes, refreshing your browser will help you see the changes.

_Accidentally Deleted Something:_
Don't panic! If you made a mistake, click Exit instead of Save and don't save changes.


_Accidentally Deleted Part of the menu code and saved:_
Don't panic! If you made a mistake in any section of the menu below is the link to the folder with menu sections saved:
https://github.com/milya1/Roccos/tree/main/menu%20repository

There are 4 files for the main menu page:
appetizers and salads - first block
rocco's specialty pizza - second block (right after salads)
build your own table - a short code with price/topping table contents (keep in mind that this block formatting looks different from other blocks)
desserts and soft drinks - the last block on the page
