Hi!
This is a repository that holds tutorial/standard operating procedure (SOP) for updating the menu for your restaurant on Squarespace.

You can find 3 main folders:

**SOPs** - contains the tutorial on how to edit menus ("How to change menu in Squarespace");
**logos** - where logo variations are included;
**menu repository** - contains the code for blocks on the main menu page, in case you deleted something or the formatting broke and you don't know what to do;


You might also notice three other files:
.gitattributes, LICENSE, README.md
 these files are standard for the GitHub, and you don't need to look into those.
